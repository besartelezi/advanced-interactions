# Advanced Interactions
[Take a look at this project here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjS6bQ5OQ-o)

Advanced Interactions with Javascript, now that's a challenge! The requirements for this project are:
* A working parallax carousel.
* A collage of images, and when you click on one of the images, it will enlarge and give you a short description.
* Hovering over a piece of text, in this case a Pokémon's name, it will create a small pop-up image above that name with an image of what the Pokémon looks like. 
* A chasing circle, a red dot must chase the cursor as long as it is within a box on the website.
* Another chasing circle, but this time it's a green dot that *runs away* from the cursor.
* Have letters that are inside a span class do something of your choosing (let the letter "e" disappear, let the letter "a" rotate, etc.).
* A lightmode/darkmode switch

The minimum requirement for this project are just the three first requirements and one chasing circle of your choosing. I will however, try to finish all requirements. If I run out of time before I can finish everything, I want to at least have a funcioning lightmode/darkmode switch. I think learning how to make such a switch might be very essential to becoming a pro Web Developer. Also I hate lightmode. 

## Parallax Carousel, not Paarthurnax Carousel
I'd like to say that I know how to start with this one, but that would make me a dirty liar. For now, I will try and figure out how I'd like to start on creating a parallax carousel, and look for how other people have made their parallax carousels. </br>

The way I'm thinking of doing it, is by creating an array of objects, with the objects being different images. Then, have a 'back' and 'next' button at the sides of the carousel, that will just change the image src of the carousel to the next one in the array. But what about the parallax effect? <br>

As of now, I might need to take a step back and take in all kinds of new information. If I start on this project by just using my current knowledge of Javascript, I'll learn nothing. So the very first step will be research, *research*, and **research**!
